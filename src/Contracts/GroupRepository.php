/**
 * Contract for storing and managing feature group definitions.
 *
 * Feature group repositories abstract the storage layer for group definitions,
 * enabling different backends (in-memory arrays, databases, caches, etc.) to
 * persist and retrieve collections of related features.
 *
 * This contract focuses solely on group definitions (which features belong to
 * which groups), not on membership (which contexts have access to groups). For
 * membership management, see FeatureGroupMembershipRepository.
 *
 * Use cases include:
 * - Defining feature sets for different subscription tiers
 * - Organizing experimental features into beta programmes
 * - Grouping related features that ship together in releases
 * - Managing feature dependencies through group composition
 *
 * ```php
 * // Define groups with features and metadata
 * $repository->define('premium-tier', [
 *     'advanced-analytics',
 *     'priority-support',
 *     'custom-branding'
 * ], [
 *     'description' => 'Premium subscription features',
 *     'tier' => 'premium'
 * ]);
 *
 * // Retrieve and manipulate groups
 * $features = $repository->get('premium-tier');
 * $repository->addFeatures('premium-tier', ['api-access']);
 * ```
