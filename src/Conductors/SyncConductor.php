/**
 * Sync conductor for complete replacement of features or groups for a context.
 *
 * Implements the sync pattern similar to Laravel's relationship syncing, where the provided
 * feature set completely replaces existing features. Any features not in the new list are
 * removed, and any in the new list are added. This ensures the context has exactly the
 * specified features, no more, no less.
 *
 * ```php
 * // Replace all features with new set
 * Toggl::sync($user)->features(['premium', 'analytics', 'notifications']);
 *
 * // Replace all feature group memberships
 * Toggl::sync($organization)->groups(['beta-testers', 'early-adopters']);
 *
 * // Replace with valued features
 * Toggl::sync($user)->withValues([
 *     'theme' => 'dark',
 *     'language' => 'en',
 *     'timezone' => 'UTC'
 * ]);
 * ```
